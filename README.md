# Brain Games

**Brain Games** is a collection of interactive command-line games designed to test your math and logic skills. Each game offers a challenge, ranging from determining whether a number is prime to solving arithmetic progressions. The games are developed in JavaScript and are run through the terminal.

## Games Included

- **Even Check**: Determine if a number is even.
    [Here is the demo of the game](https://asciinema.org/a/RyZXTceawCzvYx8YvsztHebL6)

- **Calculator**: Solve basic math expressions.
    [Here is the demo of the game](https://asciinema.org/a/PRVU7XZGBQDqNtK3Yw2c1V2hl)

- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Find the GCD of two numbers.
    [Here is the demo of the game](https://asciinema.org/a/vZ55otv4SlFUNk2jkds0k6qRt)

- **Arithmetic Progression**: Identify the missing number in a progression.
